    <h2><em>About Myself</em></h2>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Adan Millard. This is a little intro about me and what I get up to in my personal time.
    </p>

    <p>I’m big into my cars, I currently own a 180sx which I’ve owned for over 5 years. It had a fresh paint job not too long ago. I love to drive it on sunny days and work on it in my free time. It’s become a passion of mine and a goal to put it in a garage
        and do up the engine.</p><a href="car.html">Here is a picture of it.</a>



    <p>I love going to the gym, I’ve been going every morning for the last 10 years. It’s a good way to promote overall good health and well being. My love for fitness has really turned from a hobby into a passion.
        If I don’t have a morning workout I don’t have the same energy throughout the day.</p>

    <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing video games.</p>

    <p>I enjoy going out with friends, having a BBQ and drinking a couple beers.</p>
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>The Journey</h2>
    <p>My goal is to become a Full Stack Web Developer. </p>
    <p>For the last 10 Years, I have been working in a warehouse environment, during the lockdown of 2021 I had a change of heart and decided that I no longer wanted to continue down this path. I have been the Warehouse Manager at NZ Muscle for the last
        2 years and have gained valuable management skills while doing this.
    </p>
    <p>While searching for a new job, I asked my friend about programming and what I'd have to do to get into the industry. I thought you needed to be a math genius and go through 3 years of university to get the degree. He told me that I could learn alot
        online at places like udemy, so off I went and bought my first course on Javascript. I studied each day over the lockdown learning more and more. </p>
    <p>I have recently enrolled for a bootcamp and Mission Ready HQ, where I will learn the skills necessary to become a Web Developer.
    </p>
    <p>This is my starting CV, come with me on the journey as I update this CV from a simple HTML formatted Web Page in a stunning looking, fully functional web page.
